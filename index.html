										<h2 class="major">Thame Ultimate</h2>
										<p>We're a small, relatively new, and very welcoming group of players. We have a mixture of ages, genders, and playing experience. The majority of people in the club have been playing for less than two years, and we have have players aged between 15 and somewhere-north-of-late-30s, so you won't feel out of place.</p>
										<p>We train once a week all year round: outdoors when there's enough daylight in the sky in the evenings; indoors otherwise. We also go to a few tournaments each year as a team, or arrange friendlies between other local teams.</p>
