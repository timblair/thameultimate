        <p>We're a small, welcoming group of players. We have a mixture of ages, genders, and playing experience. The majority of people in the club have only been playing for a short while, and we have have players aged between 16 and, well, let's just say somewhere-north-of-late-30s, so you won't feel out of place.</p>
        <p>We have weekly training sessions, and we go to a few tournaments each year as a team, or arrange friendlies between other local teams.</p>
