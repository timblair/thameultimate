										<h2 class="major">What is Ultimate?</h2>

										<p>Ultimate is a team sport, combining the passing and moving fromgames such as netball or basketball with the skill of throwing a disc (a Frisbee).</p>

										<p>Ultimate is an inclusive sport built on "Spirit of the Game". It stresses sportsmanship and fair play. Competitive play is encouraged but not at the expense of respect between players and respect the game, adherence to the rules, and the basic joy of play.</p>

										<p>The disc lets players develop new throwing skills which is great fun and can also offer something for children who are disengaged by traditional offers or other ball sports. As a non-contact sport, it is safefor pupils of a range of ages to play alongside each other.</p>

										<p>The game is self-refereed at all levels. Self-refereeing helps develop communication, empathy and resiliance. When one player feels that another has broken the rules (intentionally or accidentally), they stopplay and discuss the situation with the other players involved. Together they quickly come to a decision on how best (i.e. most fairly) to re-start play. Players are encouraged to provide their point of view, listen to the views of others and calmly come to an agreement on what happened. As many incidents involve a degee of subjectivity, it is ok for players to disagree, and the rules accommodate this.</p>
